# Bonjour !
Hello there and thanks for stopping by. My ongoing work in Python and R is showcased here. These are projects done out of my personal interests. I have kept my work as original as practically possible, but in this world of google ... allow me to acknowledge the contribution of others whose code may have found in here unconciously! Feel free to explore the repositories on your own or better still, start here to navigate.
